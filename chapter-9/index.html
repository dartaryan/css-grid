    <h2>Venus, Earth, Moon, and Mars</h2>

         alt="Graphic showing the relative sizes of Venus, Earth, Moon, and Mars. Earth and Venus are nearly the same size. Mars is roughly 1/2 the size of Earth, while the Moon is 1/4 the size of Earth."/>
    <p>Venus and Earth are often called sister planets because of their similar size and mass. However, their
      environments couldn't be more different. Earth is home to diverse ecosystems and abundant water, while Venus is a
      scorching planet with clouds of sulfuric acid. Mars, about half the size of Earth, has captivated scientists for
      decades with its dry, dusty surface and evidence of ancient water. The Moon, Earth's only natural satellite, is
      about one-quarter the size of our planet and plays a crucial role in influencing Earth's tides.</p>

    <h2>Venus: The Hottest Planet</h2>
    <p>Despite being farther from the Sun than Mercury, Venus holds the title of the hottest planet in our solar system.
      This is due to its thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide, which traps heat through a runaway greenhouse effect,
      causing surface temperatures to soar above 450°C (840°F).</p>

    <h2>Earth: Our Blue Planet</h2>
    <p>Earth is unique in the solar system due to its liquid water, diverse ecosystems, and life-sustaining atmosphere.
      It orbits the Sun at an ideal distance, known as the habitable zone, allowing for a moderate climate where life
      can thrive.</p>

    <h2>Mars: The Red Planet</h2>
    <p>Mars, often called the Red Planet because of its iron oxide-rich soil, has fascinated humans for centuries.
      Although it's a cold desert today, evidence suggests it once had flowing water, raising the tantalizing
      possibility that life may have existed there in the past.</p>

    <h2>The Moon: Earth's Companion</h2>
    <p>The Moon is Earth's closest neighbor in space. Its phases, from full to crescent, have guided human activities
      for millennia. Scientists believe it formed from debris left over after a massive collision between Earth and a
      Mars-sized body early in our planet's history.</p>
